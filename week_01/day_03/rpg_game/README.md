## Ready to fight ? :mega:
Clone the repository, open index.html and your console. 
You'll be asked to choose which character you want to play among 7 types (it can be one, none or all !).

At each turn, you will be asked to choose your victim, and if you want to use your special attack or the classic. 

You can check the stats at any time by typing `game.showStats()` in your console.

Each game lasts 10 turns, unless only one is still standing :skull:
